# Task 1
# Exercise: use the print statement to print
# Your name
# Your address
# Your interests
# Perform either addition or calculation with two numbers
# Use text in your addition

print("My name is Stewart.")
print("I live at 123 Fake Street, London, UK.")
print("My interests include coding, football, and astronomy.")
print(f"The sum of 1 and 1 is: {1+1}")

# There was no task 2
# Task 3: using input function
# complete the rest of the code
# Use a variable and invoke the input function to ask the user for a second number
# add the two numbers
# print out the total of the two numbers

# JS Python comparison
# JS uses window.prompt() to get user input, Python uses input
first_number = int(input("Enter first number: "))
second_number = int(input("Enter second number: "))
total = first_number + second_number
print(f"The sum of the two numbers is: {total}.")

# JS Python comparison
# JS has array type, Python has more types of array (3) than JS 
# (1) list: ordered
# (2) tuples: ordered, cannot be changed (and are thus faster than lists)
# (3) set: unordered: list of unique items
# JS has object type whereas Python has dictionary type (Python keys must be string or number)
